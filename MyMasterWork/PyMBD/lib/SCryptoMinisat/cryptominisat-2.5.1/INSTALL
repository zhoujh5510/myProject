-----------
Libraries needed
-----------
You will need the following libraries to compile the sources:
* libz

-----------------
Building the source
-----------------
There are two ways to build the source. With cmake or with autotools.
I personally use cmake.

-----------------
Building using cmake
-----------------
* Install cmake
* Go into the 'build' directory
* Issue 'cmake ../'
* Issue 'make'
* Issue './cryptominisat satfile.cnf'
  to test your new code.

------------------
Building using autotools
------------------
* Go to the 'build' directory
* Issue '../configure'
* Issue 'make'
* Issue './cryptominisat satfile.cnf' to test your new code

If you got your source from the GIT/SVN, then you should do the following
before doing the above::
* Install automake, autoconf, libtool
* Issue 'make -f Makefile.cvs' in the root dir of the source

---------
Please read help
---------
For help, build the program, and issue:
'./cryptominisat -help'

--------------
Verbose debug
-------------
You can also turn on verbose debugging.
Simply remove the comment before 

"//#define VERBOSE_DEBUG" 
in Solver/constants.h and re-compile

When executing:

'./cryptominisat satfile.cnf'
You will see a LOT of debug info. You should therefore maybe do:

'./cryptominisat satfile.cnf > debuginfo.txt'
then you can open the 'debuginfo.txt' file from a text editor and have a look

--------------------------
Windows binary generation
-------------------------
It should be possible f you compile under windows
using Visual C++. Please read the HOWTO_VisualCpp for details

I compile under linux all windows binaries, using gcc that generates 
windows executables. It works really well. There is a sort-of-howto in 
the "HOWTO_MinGW32" text file. A short step-by-step is here: 

1) Install gcc that generates windows binaries:

i586-mingw32msvc

1) Install all libraries (libz) 

libz:
get from source and compile as per "Solver/win32-howto"

2) complie:

go to the "Solver" subdir and execute:

i586-mingw32msvc-g++ -O3 -g -DCROSS_COMPILE  -march=i586 -I../mtl/ -I../MTRand/ \
/usr/i586-mingw32msvc/lib/libz.a Main.C Solver.C Logger.C  Clause.cpp \
VarReplacer.cpp FindUndef.cpp XorFinder.cpp XorSubsumer.cpp Subsumer.cpp \
Conglomerate.cpp PackedRow.cpp FailedVarSearcher.cpp PartFinder.cpp \
PartHander.cpp -o cryptominisat.exe

I test the generated binary under wine, in Linux.
