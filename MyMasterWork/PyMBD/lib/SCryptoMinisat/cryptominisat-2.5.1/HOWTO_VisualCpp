If compiling with Visual C, the CHUNK_LIMIT poses problems.
Problem is, that VC2008 seems to have a too small default stack, which is not big enough.
With default command line parameters it will crash.
The workaround is to give the command line parameter /F. With this you can
increase the stack to a certain size. Setting it to 2 MB is good enough

ZLIB might also pose problems. If you cannot correctly compile it under
windows, I suggest you add the -DDISABLE_ZLIB to your compilation flags.

The compilation instruction should therefore be:
cl /favor:INTEL64 /O2 /Fecryptominisat.exe -DDISABLE_ZLIB /F2097152
/TP /EHsc -I. -I../mtl/ -I../MTRand/ Main.C Logger.cpp Solver.cpp
ClauseCleaner.cpp Conglomerate.cpp FindUndef.cpp
PackedRow.cpp RestartTypeChooser.cpp VarReplacer.cpp
XorFinder.cpp XorSubsumer.cpp Subsumer.cpp PartFinder.cpp
PartHandler.cpp FailedVarSearcher.cpp Gaussian.cpp
MatrixFinder.cpp

executed from the 'Solver' subdirectory
